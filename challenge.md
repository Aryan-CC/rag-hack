# Challenge: Build a Stock and Crypto Summarizer and Q&A Bot 

### Estimated Time: 120 mins
  
## Problem Statement

Create a multi-functional bot using Copilot Studio with a Master Topic and Subtopic structure. The bot should provide a General Q&A feature for answering queries related to stock and cryptocurrency performance and a Summarizer feature for generating detailed summaries from user inputs. The solution requires a dynamic workflow to guide functionality selection and ensure tailored interactions. The design should emphasize interactive workflows, modularity, and effective knowledge base utilization.

## Goals

- Create a multi-functional bot using Copilot Studio with a clear Master Topic and Subtopic structure.

- Implement a General Q&A bot to provide answers on stock and cryptocurrency performance.

- Develop a Summarizer bot capable of generating detailed summaries based on user inputs.

## Datasets 

- You can download the datasets for this challenge using the [financeial_datasets]() link.

## Challenge Objectives  

### Creation of Subtopics

- **Objective 1:** Create a Stocks Topic with a knowledge base for stock-specific queries and summaries.

- **Objective 2:** Create a Crypto Topic with a knowledge base for cryptocurrency-specific queries and summaries.
